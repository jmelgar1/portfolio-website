# Portfolio Website - Change Log

This file tracks modifications, decisions, and rationale for changes made to the codebase.

## 2025-07-01 - Documentation Organization

### Changes Made
- **Moved CHANGELOG.md to logs/ directory** for better organization
- **Updated CLAUDE.md** to reference new log file location
- **Updated CHANGELOG.md** to reflect directory reorganization

### Files Modified
- `/logs/CHANGELOG.md` - Moved from root directory
- `/logs/` - New directory created for tracking files
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated Change Tracking section path reference

## 2025-07-01 - CLAUDE.md Documentation Update

### Changes Made
- **Updated CLAUDE.md** to reflect current codebase state
- **Added Change Tracking section** to CLAUDE.md
- **Created CHANGELOG.md** for ongoing change documentation

### Files Modified
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Complete rewrite of architecture documentation
- `/logs/CHANGELOG.md` - New file created (originally as `/CHANGELOG.md`)

### Key Decisions
1. **Removed outdated documentation**: The previous CLAUDE.md referenced many files that no longer exist (scene management system, terrain utilities, asset management files)
2. **Focused on current architecture**: Updated to describe the actual current structure with minimal Three.js setup
3. **Accurate dependency versions**: Updated version numbers to match current package.json
4. **Simplified scope**: Reflected that the current codebase is a basic portfolio with horizontal scrolling, not the complex 3D scene system described previously

### Rationale
- The documentation was misleading and would cause confusion for future developers
- Need accurate reference for current architecture and available components
- Established change tracking process to maintain documentation accuracy going forward

### Current State Summary
- React 19 portfolio website with horizontal scrolling
- Basic Three.js canvas setup (minimal lighting only)
- Three main sections: intro, work, projects
- Custom useHorizontalScroll hook for navigation
- No complex 3D scenes or asset management currently implemented
