## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Cursor trail becomes unaligned when resizing the window. After refresh it becomes aligned again but needed to ensure cursor trail stays aligned during window resize.

## Root Cause
The canvas dimensions were only set once during component mount (`useEffect`), but weren't updated when the window was resized. This caused the canvas coordinate system to become misaligned with the actual window size.

## Solution Implemented
Added window resize listener to dynamically update canvas dimensions:

### Changes Made to `src/components/CursorTrail.tsx`:
1. Created `updateCanvasSize()` function to handle canvas dimension updates
2. Added `window.addEventListener("resize", updateCanvasSize)` to track window resize events
3. Added proper cleanup in the useEffect return function to remove the resize listener

### Code Changes:
- Wrapped canvas sizing logic in `updateCanvasSize()` function
- Added resize event listener alongside existing mousemove listener
- Ensured proper cleanup of both event listeners in useEffect cleanup

## Result
Cursor trail now maintains perfect alignment with the mouse cursor even during window resize operations. No refresh required.
