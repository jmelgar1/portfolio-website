# Session Log - July 9, 2025 (Session 1)

## Overview
Added cursor trail visual effect to the portfolio website and fixed session log file naming conventions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Session Log Format Fix (884cce7)
- **Files Modified**: `CLAUDE.md`, renamed log files
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated session log naming format from `dd-mm-yyyy` to `mm-dd-yyyy` format
  - Renamed existing log files to match new convention:
    - `01-07-2025 s1.md` → `07-01-2025 s1.md`
    - `02-07-2025 s1.md` → `07-02-2025 s1.md`  
    - `02-07-2025 s2.md` → `07-02-2025 s2.md`
- **Reasoning**: Standardized date format for better organization and sorting

### 2. Basic Cursor Trail Implementation (5663f6e)
- **Files Created**: 
  - `src/components/CursorTrail.js` - Main cursor trail component
  - `src/components/CursorTrail.css` - Styling for cursor trail effect
- **Files Modified**: `src/App.js` - Added CursorTrail component import and usage
- **Features Added**:
  - Mouse position tracking with smooth following animation
  - Multiple trail particles with decreasing opacity
  - CSS animations for smooth particle movement
  - Trail particles follow cursor with delay for organic effect

### 3. Enhanced Cursor Trail (2f01b47)
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/CursorTrail.js` - Major refactor and enhancement
  - `src/components/CursorTrail.css` - Simplified styling
  - `src/App.js` - Minor integration updates
- **Enhancements**:
  - Improved performance with optimized particle system
  - Better animation smoothness and responsiveness
  - Reduced CSS complexity while maintaining visual appeal
  - Enhanced particle behavior and trail effect

## Technical Details

### Cursor Trail Implementation
- Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management
- Tracks mouse position with `mousemove` event listeners
- Implements particle system with configurable trail length
- Smooth interpolation between positions for natural movement
- CSS transforms for hardware-accelerated animations

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient event handling with proper cleanup
- Optimized re-rendering with appropriate dependencies
- Smooth animations using CSS transforms rather than layout changes

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance impact of cursor trail on different devices
- Consider adding user preference toggle for cursor trail effect
- Potential integration with Three.js scene for interactive particle effects
