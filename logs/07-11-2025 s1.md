## Summary
Implemented shooting stars feature in the Three.js background and modularized the ThreeJSBackground component for better architecture and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Shooting Stars Implementation
- **Created ShootingStars component** with realistic edge-to-edge movement
- **Accurate viewport calculation** using camera frustum math to determine exact canvas bounds
- **Edge spawning system** that spawns stars just outside visible viewport edges
- **Trail effects** with fading particles that follow each shooting star
- **Automatic despawning** when stars exit the visible area to prevent performance issues
- **Variable speed and timing** for natural randomization (spawn every 1.5-3.5 seconds, speeds 8-20 units/sec)

### 2. Component Modularization
Refactored the monolithic ThreeJSBackground.tsx into a clean, modular architecture:

**New File Structure:**
```
src/components/threejs/
├── ThreeJSBackground.tsx     # Main orchestrator component
├── Starfield.tsx            # Static and twinkling stars management
├── ShootingStars.tsx        # Shooting star system with trails
├── TwinklingStarGroup.tsx   # Individual twinkling star group logic
├── types.ts                 # Shared TypeScript interfaces
├── utils.ts                 # Shared utility functions (camera math, bounds checking)
└── index.ts                 # Barrel exports for clean imports
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components can be imported and used independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual features without affecting others
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript interfaces ensure consistency
- **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested in isolation

### 3. Shared Utilities Created
- `getCanvasBounds(depth)` - Calculates exact viewport bounds based on camera frustum
- `isOutOfBounds(position, bounds)` - Checks if objects have exited visible area
- `generateStarInFrustum(depth)` - Generates star positions within camera view

### 4. Type Definitions
Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces:
- `ShootingStar` - Individual shooting star properties
- `TwinklingStarGroupProps` - Props for twinkling star groups
- `CanvasBounds` - Viewport boundary structure
- `CameraConfig` - Camera configuration interface

## Technical Details

### Shooting Star Algorithm
1. **Spawn Calculation**: Uses camera FOV (75°), position (5 units), and aspect ratio to calculate exact screen edges
2. **Edge Selection**: Randomly selects one of 4 edges (left, right, top, bottom) for spawn point
3. **Trajectory**: Creates straight-line path to opposite edge with slight randomization
4. **Performance**: Limited to 10-particle trails, automatic cleanup when out of bounds

### Camera Math
```typescript
const distance = cameraPosition + Math.abs(depth);
const fovRad = (75 * Math.PI) / 180;
const halfHeight = Math.tan(fovRad / 2) * distance;
const halfWidth = halfHeight * aspectRatio;
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/threejs/ThreeJSBackground.tsx` - Simplified main component
- **Created**: `src/components/threejs/Starfield.tsx`
- **Created**: `src/components/threejs/ShootingStars.tsx` 
- **Created**: `src/components/threejs/TwinklingStarGroup.tsx`
- **Created**: `src/components/threejs/types.ts`
- **Created**: `src/components/threejs/utils.ts`
- **Created**: `src/components/threejs/index.ts`

## Functionality Preserved
- All existing starfield behavior maintained (static + twinkling stars)
- Lighting and camera settings unchanged
- Performance optimizations retained
- Component props and interface unchanged

## Future Considerations
- Components are now easily extendable for additional effects
- Shared utilities can be reused for other 3D features
- Individual components can be performance-profiled independently
- Easy to add unit tests for each component
