# Session Log - July 10, 2025 (Session 2)

### Scroll Limitation Update
- **Change**: Updated `maxScroll` from 350 to 200 in `src/App.tsx:18`
- **Reason**: Prevent scrolling past featured projects section after NodeNetwork removal
- **Impact**: Users can no longer scroll beyond the three main sections (intro, work, projects)

### Starfield Movement Fix
- **Issue**: Starfield was moving during scroll, creating distracting parallax effects
- **Solution**: Made starfield completely static by:
  - Removing `scrollPosition` prop dependency from `Starfield` component
  - Removing `StarfieldProps` interface
  - Setting starfield position to `[0, 0, 0]` permanently
  - Memoizing star positions with `useMemo` to prevent regeneration on re-renders
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/threejs/ThreeJSBackground.tsx:16-24, 62`

### Smooth Scrolling Enhancement
- **Inspiration**: Adapted smooth scrolling technique from CodeSandbox demo
- **Implementation**: Complete rewrite of `useHorizontalScroll` hook using continuous animation loop
- **Key Features**:
  - Continuous `requestAnimationFrame` loop instead of start/stop animations
  - Easing interpolation: `previous += (current - previous) * ease`
  - Separated current/target values for smooth transitions
  - Precision rounding to 2 decimal places
  - Eliminated `targetScrollPosition` references (fixed undefined error)
- **Files Modified**: `src/hooks/useHorizontalScroll.ts` (complete rewrite)

### Technical Improvements
- **Scrolling Algorithm**: Now uses proper easing with `scrollData.current` and `scrollData.previous`
- **Performance**: Continuous animation loop provides smoother, more consistent scrolling
- **Error Fix**: Resolved "targetScrollPosition is not defined" error through proper variable cleanup
- **User Experience**: Significantly improved scroll smoothness and responsiveness

## Next Steps
- Test build process to ensure TypeScript integration works correctly
- Monitor for any runtime issues that may arise from type conversions
- Consider adding more specific types for complex data structures
- Evaluate adding stricter TypeScript compiler options for enhanced type safety
