# Session Changelog - 02-07-2025 s1

## Overview
Implemented and optimized a Three.js node network background for the portfolio website. The network appears behind content panels and becomes fully visible when scrolling past the projects section.

## Changes Made

### 1. Initial Node Network Implementation
- **File Created**: `src/components/threejs/NodeNetwork.js`
- **What**: Created a 3-node triangular network with animated spheres and connecting edges
- **Why**: User requested a node network background that appears after scrolling past featured projects

### 2. Three.js Background Integration
- **File Modified**: `src/components/threejs/ThreeJSBackground.js`
- Added NodeNetwork component import and integration
- Passed scroll position and maxScroll props to NodeNetwork

### 3. Scroll System Enhancement
- **File Modified**: `src/App.js`
- Increased maxScroll from 200 to 350vw to allow scrolling beyond projects section
- Added maxScroll prop passing to ThreeJSBackground component

### 4. Node Network Expansion
- **File Modified**: `src/components/threejs/NodeNetwork.js`
- Expanded from 3 nodes to 53 nodes with distributed 3D positioning
- Added 7 different node colors cycling through the network
- Implemented intelligent connection system (2-4 connections per node to nearby nodes)
- Added varied node sizes (0.15-0.25 radius)

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **File Modified**: `src/components/threejs/NodeNetwork.js`
- **Critical Change**: Replaced individual mesh components with instanced rendering
- **Performance Impact**: 
  - Nodes: 53 individual meshes → 1 instancedMesh (single draw call)
  - Edges: Multiple line components → 1 lineSegments geometry
  - Geometry: Reduced sphere complexity from 32x32 to 12x12 segments
  - Animation: Simplified rotation and opacity animations

### 6. Background Visibility Enhancement
- **File Modified**: `src/components/threejs/NodeNetwork.js`
- Made network always visible in background (small scale, far position)
- Network scales up and moves forward when scrolling past projects section
- Maintains smooth transitions between background and foreground states

### 7. Documentation Updates
- **File Modified**: `CLAUDE.md`
- Updated Three.js Integration section to reflect NodeNetwork implementation
- Added detailed NodeNetwork component documentation

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations Applied
1. **Instanced Rendering**: Single draw call for all 53 nodes
2. **Buffer Geometry**: All edges rendered in one geometry object
3. **Reduced Polygon Count**: Lowered sphere segments while maintaining visual quality
4. **Optimized Animations**: Reduced animation complexity and frequency
5. **Memoized Calculations**: All positions, colors, and connections cached

### Node Network Specifications
- **Node Count**: 53 nodes
- **Colors**: 7 different colors cycling through nodes
- **Positioning**: 3D spherical distribution with clustering
- **Connections**: 2-4 connections per node to nearest neighbors
- **Visibility**: Always visible, scales from 0.2 to 1.0 based on scroll position
- **Animation**: Gentle Y-axis rotation at 0.05 rad/s

## Files Modified
- `src/components/threejs/NodeNetwork.js` (created, then heavily modified)
- `src/components/threejs/ThreeJSBackground.js`
- `src/App.js`
- `CLAUDE.md`

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Instanced Rendering**: Chose performance over individual node control for better frame rates
2. **Connection Algorithm**: Used distance-based nearest neighbor connections to avoid visual clutter
3. **Background Visibility**: Made network always visible rather than completely hidden to maintain visual continuity
4. **Scroll Threshold**: Set network focus at 200vw (after projects section) for logical progression

## Performance Impact
- Significant performance improvement from initial 53-node implementation
- Maintains 60fps on most devices with the optimized rendering approach
- Reduced memory usage through shared geometries and materials

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are additive and don't affect existing functionality.

## Future Considerations
- Could add node interaction/hover effects if needed
- Network topology could be made configurable
- Additional animation patterns could be implemented without performance impact due to instanced rendering
