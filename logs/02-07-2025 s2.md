## Changes Made

### Node Network Enhancements
- **Increased physical size**: Doubled the node network radius from 2-6 to 4-12, expanded height variation and depth for a larger 3D presence
- **Fixed connectivity issues**: Implemented proper connection algorithm ensuring every node connects to at least one other node via chain + proximity connections
- **Removed node rotation**: Eliminated individual node rotation that was causing visual disconnect between nodes and edges
- **Centered positioning**: Set network to always center at X=0, Y=0 regardless of focus level
- **Removed pulsing effects**: Eliminated brightness pulsing animation for consistent visibility

### Visual Design Overhaul
- **Unified color scheme**: Changed from multi-colored nodes to consistent blue theme (#4a90e2 nodes, #2563eb edges)
- **Uniform orb sizing**: Made all nodes same size (0.08) for consistent "orb" appearance
- **Reduced edge brightness**: Lowered edge opacity from 0.8 to 0.4 for subtlety
- **Enhanced glow effect**: Implemented layered sphere approach with core, inner glow, and outer glow layers for lamp-like illumination

### Space Background Implementation
- **Added starfield**: Created 2000 small white stars distributed across 400x400x400 space
- **Optimized star appearance**: Made stars smaller (0.1 size), consistent, and properly distributed
- **Parallax scrolling**: Implemented subtle starfield movement based on scroll position while keeping node network stationary

## Files Modified
- `src/components/threejs/NodeNetwork.js` - Major refactoring of node generation, connection logic, and visual materials
- `src/components/threejs/ThreeJSBackground.js` - Added starfield component with scroll-based movement

## Key Decisions
- Chose layered sphere approach over shader materials for glow effect due to simplicity and cross-browser compatibility
- Used chain + proximity connection algorithm to guarantee network connectivity
- Implemented parallax effect only on background stars to maintain node network as focal point
- Selected blue color scheme (#4a90e2, #2563eb, #1e40af) for futuristic aesthetic

## Technical Notes
- Connection algorithm ensures minimum spanning tree plus additional proximity connections
- Glow effect uses 3 meshBasicMaterial layers at 1x, 1.3x, and 1.8x scale with decreasing opacity
- Starfield uses points geometry with 2000 vertices for performance
- Parallax movement uses scroll position with 2x horizontal and 1x vertical factors
